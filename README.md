## [Projects](https://debasmitaghose.github.io/Projects/) | [CV](https://debasmitaghose.github.io/CV/) | [Robots](https://debasmitaghose.github.io/Robots/)



I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Yale University,  advised by [Prof. Brian Scassellatti](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/) at the [Yale Social Robotics Lab](https://scazlab.yale.edu/). I am interested in exploring Human Robot collaboration in the context of industrial robots. My areas of interest are Robotics, Computer Vision and Embedded System Design.  


Previously, I was a Masters student of Computer Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I was working as a Graduate Research Assistant on my Masters Thesis at [Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics](https://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/), under [Prof. Rod Grupen](http://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~grupen/home.html). 

I earned my BS in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology, India where I focused on Embedded System Design and built robots. 

I have enjoyed working at Technical University of Dresden (Germany), Nanyang Technological University, (Singapore) and Siemens Corporate Technology, (Munich, Germany). 

I have been involved in projects in the domain of Robotics,  Ubiquitous Computing,  Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision. Additionally,  I am interested in the manipulation and control of robots in chaotic environments and design of UAVs.

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, photography and cooking.
