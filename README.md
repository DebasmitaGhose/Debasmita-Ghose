I am a graduate student of Computer Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. My areas of interest are Robotics, Computer Vision and Embedded System Design. During my undergraduate studies, I have been involved in building the protoypes of various systems, that can help people lead better lives, through my skills in Embedded Systems Design and have been exposed to development of UAVs. I have also been working on using Deep Learning for solving various Computer Vision problems. 

I am particularly interested in the control and perception of legged robots in chaotic environments and design of UAVs.

I have always been a curious person and my curiosity always made me ponder how things can work better. Besides incessantly wanting to learn more every day, I am greatly drawn towards travelling and photography.
